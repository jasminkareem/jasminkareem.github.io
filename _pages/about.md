Hi there, nice that you made it to my personal website :D  

I am currently a 3rd-year PhD student at both the University of Amsterdam ([IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/people/)) and Eindhoven University of Technology ([JADS](https://www.jads.nl/researcher/jasmin-kareem/)), and I am a part of the ICAI-funded [REMlab](https://icai.ai/lab/rem-lab-amsterdam/), supervised by Professor [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/) and Associate Professor [Martijn C. Willemsen](https://martijnwillemsen.nl/). My research includes explainability in news recommender systems, but I am more broadly interested in explainable AI, mechanistic interpretability, and the robustness of AI models.

Before this, I completed a Master's in Computer Science (with a specialization in Data Science) at Leiden University. For my [master's thesis](https://theses.liacs.nl/pdf/2023-2024-KareemJ.pdf), I worked on automated machine learning for neural network verification in the [ADA group](https://ada.liacs.nl/), supervised by Jan van Rijn and Holger Hoos.

Additionally, I earned my joint BSc Data Science degree from Eindhoven University of Technology and Tilburg University in 2020, with a thesis project on open source data at the Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS) ([link](https://research.tue.nl/nl/studentTheses/check-the-facts/)).
